# Cat-Facts-Galore
The purpose of Cat Facts Galore is to be a web appliction that provides the user with random cat facts that they are able to post under any anonymous name of their chosing. The user can generate a cat fact until they like one enough to post. If the user needs help coming up with a username, they can choose to generate a random username and use that one.

The API's used: Cat Facts, JSON Placeholder, and Random Data.

The Cat Facts API was chosen so that the user is able to retrieve random cat facts, one at a time. To be successful in that, the HTTP GET method was used.

The JSON Placeholder API was chosen so that the user could take whatever random cat fact they recieved and post it within my web application. The HTTP POST method was used for this API.

The Random Data API was chosen so that the user can generate a random username if they cannot come up with one. This allows them to create anonymity if they do not wish to reveal their real name. The HTTP GET method was used in order to retreive random usernames.
